Webhooks are user-defined HTTP callbacks. They are triggered by some event in a web application and can facilitate integrating different applications or third-party APIs.  

A webhook provides a way for an application to message other devices or applications with real time information when a certain event occurs.

In casdoor a Webhook is sent each time one or more of the following event occurs.
- `signup`
